  # summary:
I am a freelance front-end developer who likes to focus on responsive web designs by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, Bootstraps and Wordpress.

I started my career as an Application Development Specialist helping clients by finding solutions for technical issues between applications, and operating systems running on both macs and pcs. I have over ten years of experience in analyzing software issues and designing product solutions, including creating, editing and testing code to resolve software conflicts to prevent user downtime.

My experiences have led me to where I am today in my career as a developer, as I love creating and fixing things with code.
